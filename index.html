    <h1>Culture of Germany</h1>
    <p class="p1">
      The culture of Germany has been shaped by major intellectual and popular
      currents in Europe, both religious and secular. Historically, Germany has
      been called Das Land der Dichter und Denker (the country of poets and
      thinkers).[1] German culture originated with the Germanic tribes
      inhabiting Western and Central Europe in the bronze age. German culture
      has been the pinnacle of Europe for thousands of years. Germany has been
      responsible for various phenomena of international impact such as the
      Migration Period, Francia, the Carolingian Empire, Holy Roman Empire, the
      Medieval renaissances such as the Carolingian Renaissance, Scholasticism,
      the German Renaissance, the Printing Revolution, Protestant reformation,
      Prussia, Romanticism, and National-socialism. There are a number of public
      holidays in Germany. The country is particularly known for its Oktoberfest
      celebrations in Munich, its carnival culture and globally influential
      Christmas customs known as Weihnachten.[2][3] 3 October has been the
      national day of Germany since 1990, celebrated as the German Unity Day
      (Tag der Deutschen Einheit). The UNESCO inscribed 46 properties in Germany
      on the World Heritage List.[4] A global opinion poll for the BBC revealed
      that Germany is recognized for having the most positive influence in the
      world in 2011, 2013, and 2014.[5][6][7]

    <h2>Language</h2>
    <p id="language">
      German is the official and predominant spoken language in Germany.[8] It
      is one of 23 official languages in the European Union, and one of the
      three working languages of the European Commission, along with English and
      French. Recognised native minority languages in Germany are Danish,
      Sorbian, North Frisian and Saterland Frisian. Further Low German as a
      regional language. They are officially protected by the ECRML.[9] The most
      used immigrant languages are Turkish, Kurdish, Polish, the Balkan
      languages, and Russian. Standard German is a West Germanic language and is
      closely related to and classified alongside English, Dutch, and the
      Frisian languages. To a lesser extent, it is also related to the East
      (extinct) and North Germanic languages. Most German vocabulary is derived
      from the Germanic branch of the Indo-European language family.[10]
      Significant minorities of words are derived from Latin and Greek, with a
      smaller amount from French and most recently English (known as Denglisch).
      German is written using the Latin alphabet. In addition to the 26 standard
      letters, German has three vowels with Umlaut, namely ä, ö, and ü, as well
      as the Eszett or scharfes S (sharp s) which is written "ß". German
      orthography has gone through a series of reforms, the most recent in 1996.
      German dialects are distinguished from varieties of standard German.[11]
      German dialects are traditional local varieties and can be traced back to
      the different German tribes. Many of them are not easily understandable to
      a speaker of standard German, since they often differ in lexicon,
      phonology, and syntax. Around the world, German has approximately 100
      million native speakers and also about 80 million non-native speakers.[12]
      German is the main language of about 90 million people (18%) in the EU.
      67% of German citizens claim to be able to communicate in at least one
      foreign language, 27% in at least two languages other than their first.[8]
      In the German diaspora, aspects of German culture are passed on to younger
      generations through naming customs and through the use of spoken and
      written German. The Goethe Institute seeks to spread the knowledge of
      German culture worldwide. A total of 15.5 million people are currently
      learning German as a second language.[13]

    <h2>Literature</h2>
    <p class="p2">
      German literature can be traced back to the Middle Ages, with the most
      notable authors of the period being Walther von der Vogelweide and Wolfram
      von Eschenbach. The Nibelungenlied, whose author remains unknown, is also
      an important work of the epoch, as is the Thidrekssaga. The fairy tales
      collections collected and published by Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm in the 19th
      century became famous throughout the world. Theologian Luther, who
      translated the Bible into German, is widely credited for having set the
      basis for the modern "High German" language. Among the most admired German
      philosophers and authors are Lessing, Goethe, Schiller, Kleist, Hoffmann,
      Brecht, Heine and Schmidt. Nine Germans have won the Nobel Prize in
      literature: Theodor Mommsen, Paul von Heyse, Gerhart Hauptmann, Thomas
      Mann, Nelly Sachs, Hermann Hesse, Heinrich Böll, Günter Grass, and Herta
      Müller.

    <h2>Philosophy</h2>
    <p>
      The rise of the modern natural sciences and the related decline of
      religion raised a series of questions, which recur throughout German
      philosophy, concerning the relationships between knowledge and faith,
      reason and emotion, and scientific, ethical, and artistic ways of seeing
      the world. German philosophers have helped shape western philosophy from
      as early as the Middle Ages (Albertus Magnus). Later, Leibniz (17th
      century) and most importantly Kant played central roles in the history of
      philosophy. Kantianism inspired the work of Schopenhauer and Nietzsche as
      well as German idealism defended by Fichte and Hegel. Marx and Engels
      developed communist theory in the second half of the 19th century while
      Heidegger and Gadamer pursued the tradition of German philosophy in the
      20th century. A number of German intellectuals were also influential in
      sociology, most notably Adorno, Elias, Habermas, Horkheimer, Luhmann,
      Marcuse, Simmel, Tönnies, and Weber. The University of Berlin founded in
      1810 by linguist and philosopher Wilhelm von Humboldt served as an
      influential model for a number of modern western universities. In the 21st
      century Germany has been an important country for the development of
      contemporary analytic philosophy in continental Europe, along with France,
      Austria, Switzerland and the Scandinavian countries.[14]

    <h2>Music</h2>
    <p>
      In the field of music, Germany claims some of the most renowned classical
      composers of the world, including Bach and Beethoven, who marked the
      transition between the Classical and Romantic eras in Western classical
      music. Also, Germans developed many Lutheran chorales and hymns. Other
      composers of the Austro-German tradition who achieved international fame
      include Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Brahms, Wagner, Haydn, Schubert, Händel,
      Schumann, Mendelssohn Bartholdy, Johann Strauss II, Bruckner, Mahler,
      Telemann, Richard Strauss, Schoenberg, Orff, and most recently, Henze,
      Lachenmann, and Stockhausen. Germany is the largest music market in
      Europe, and third largest in the world.[15] It has exerted a strong
      influence on techno and rock music, and pioneered trance music. Artists
      such as Herbert Grönemeyer, Scorpions, Blind Guardian, Rammstein, Nena,
      Xavier Naidoo, Tokio Hotel and Modern Talking have enjoyed international
      fame. German musicians, and particularly the pioneering bands Tangerine
      Dream and Kraftwerk, have also contributed to the development of
      electronic music.[16][17]. German popular music of the 20th and 21st
      centuries includes the movements of Neue Deutsche Welle (Nena,
      Alphaville), Ostrock (City, Keimzeit), Metal/Rock, Punk (Nina Hagen, Böhse
      Onkelz, Die Ärzte, Die Toten Hosen), Pop rock (Beatsteaks), Indie
      (Tocotronic, Blumfeld) and Hip Hop (Die Fantastischen Vier, Deichkind). A
      global trendsetter is the German Minimal and Techno scene (e.g. Ricardo
      Villalobos, Paul Kalkbrenner and Sven Vath). Germany hosts many large rock
      music festivals every year. The Rock am Ring festival is the largest music
      festival in Germany, and among the largest in the world. German artists
      also make up a large percentage of Industrial music acts, which is called
      Neue Deutsche Härte. Germany hosts some of the largest Goth scenes and
      festivals in the entire world, with events like Wave-Gotik-Treffen and
      M'era Luna Festival attracting up to 30,000 people. In addition, the
      country hosts Wacken Open Air, the biggest heavy metal open air festival
      in the world. Since about 1970, Germany has once again had a thriving
      popular culture, now increasingly led by its reinstated capital Berlin,
      and a self-confident music and art scene. Germany is also very well known
      for its many renowned opera houses, such as Semperoper, Komische Oper
      Berlin and Munich State Theatre. Richard Wagner established the Bayreuth
      Festspielhaus. One of the most famous composers of the international film
      business is Hans Zimmer. The year 2020 was designated “Beethoven Year” to
      mark 250 years since the composer was born.[18]

    <h2>Cinema</h2>
    <p class="cinema">
      German cinema dates back to the very early years of the medium with the
      work of Max Skladanowsky. It was particularly influential during the years
      of the Weimar Republic with German expressionists such as Robert Wiene and
      Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau. Austrian-based director Fritz Lang, who became a
      German citizen in 1926 and whose career flourished in the pre-war German
      film industry, is said to have been a major influence on Hollywood cinema.
      His silent movie Metropolis (1927) is referred to as the birth of modern
      Science Fiction movies. Founded in 1912, the Babelsberg Film Studio is the
      oldest large-scale film studio in the world. In 1930, Josef von Sternberg
      directed The Blue Angel, which was the first major German sound film and
      it brought world fame to actress Marlene Dietrich.[19] Impressionist
      documentary Berlin: Symphony of a Great City, directed by Walter Ruttmann,
      is a prominent example of the city symphony genre. The Nazi era produced
      mostly propaganda films although the work of Leni Riefenstahl still
      introduced new aesthetics to film.[20]. During the 1970s and 1980s, New
      German Cinema directors such as Volker Schlöndorff, Werner Herzog, Wim
      Wenders, and Rainer Werner Fassbinder put West German cinema back on the
      international stage with their often provocative films.[21] More recently,
      films such as Good Bye Lenin! (2003), Gegen die Wand (Head-on) (2004), Der
      Untergang (Downfall) (2004), and Der Baader Meinhof Komplex (2008) have
      enjoyed international success. The Academy Award for Best Foreign Language
      Film went to the German production Die Blechtrommel (The Tin Drum) in
      1979, to Nowhere in Africa in 2002, and to Das Leben der Anderen (The
      Lives of Others) in 2007.[22] Among the most famous German actors are
      Marlene Dietrich, Klaus Kinski, Hanna Schygulla, Armin Mueller-Stahl,
      Jürgen Prochnow, Thomas Kretschmann, Til Schweiger and Daniel Brühl. The
      Berlin Film Festival, held annually since 1951, is one of the world's
      foremost film festivals. An international jury places emphasis on
      representing films from all over the world and awards the winners with the
      Golden and Silver Bears.[23] The annual European Film Awards ceremony is
      held every second year in the city of Berlin, where the European Film
      Academy (EFA) is located. The Babelsberg Studios in Potsdam are the oldest
      large-scale film studios in the world and a centre for international film
      production.

    <h2>Media</h2>
    <p>
      Germany's television market is the largest in Europe, with 34,000,000 TV
      households. The many regional and national public broadcasters are
      organised in line with the federal political structure. Around 90% of
      German households have cable or satellite TV, and viewers can choose from
      a variety of free-to-view public and commercial channels. Pay-TV services
      have not become popular or successful while public TV broadcasters ZDF and
      ARD offer a range of digital-only channels.[24] Reality TV is the most
      popular programming in Germany and a key part in modern German culture.
      Germany is home to some of the world's largest media conglomerates,
      including Bertelsmann, the Axel Springer AG and ProSiebenSat.1 Media. The
      German-speaking book publishers produce about 700,000,000 copies of books
      every year, with about 80,000 titles, nearly 60,000 of them new
      publications. Germany is in third place on international statistics after
      the English-speaking book market and the People's Republic of China.[25]
      The Frankfurt Book Fair is considered to be the most important book fair
      in the world for international deals and trading and has a tradition that
      spans over 500 years. Many of Europe's best-selling newspapers and
      magazines are produced in Germany. The papers with the highest circulation
      are Die Zeit, Süddeutsche Zeitung, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung and Die
      Welt, the largest magazines include Der Spiegel, Stern and Focus. The Bild
      is a tabloid and has the largest circulation of all German papers.[26]
      However, the publishing industry is in flux – amongst other things because
      meanwhile almost 800,000 newspaper copies sold daily are distributed
      digitally and the number of digital subscriptions is continually rising.
      Nevertheless, a total of around 38 million people in Germany still read a
      printed newspaper every day, while around 14.6 million make use of
      newspapers’ digital offerings.[27]

    <h2>Architecture</h2>
    <p id="arc">
      Architectural contributions from Germany include the Carolingian and
      Ottonian styles, important precursors of Romanesque. The
      region[clarification needed] has also produced significant works in styles
      such as the Gothic, Renaissance and Baroque. The nation was particularly
      important in the early modern movement through the Deutscher Werkbund and
      the Bauhaus movement identified with Walter Gropius. The Nazis closed
      these movements and favoured a type of neo-classicism. Since World War II
      post-modern structures have been built. Since the reunification of Germany
      the trend has continued.
